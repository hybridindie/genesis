Review the acceptance criteria of an Epic or story. Report concrete problems and
replacements; do not rewrite the whole document.

## Inputs

- Required: the Epic or story body, or the criteria block.
- Read: `.agents/doctrine/acceptance-criteria-rules.md`.
- Do not read: implementation code unless a criterion names a contract that
  cannot be judged without it.

## Deterministic Steps

1. **Extract criteria.** Run
   `python3 .agents/scripts/validate_artifact.py --kind acceptance <artifact>`;
   use its `ACn` labels and text. Stop if it reports no criteria.
2. **Run the fixed checklist** on each criterion:
   - observable by a user, operator, or test;
   - testable with a clear pass/fail;
   - specific actor, trigger, and condition;
   - outcome-focused, not implementation;
   - consistent with the other criteria and constraints;
   - covers the relevant empty/invalid/duplicate/permission/timeout/partial-
     failure edges;
   - bounded by the non-functional constraint it depends on.
3. **Classify each finding:** `Blocking`, `Improve`, or `Optional`.
4. **Write one replacement** per finding. Do not add requirements the sources do
   not support.
5. **Check coverage.** Name any Epic outcome or edge case with no criterion.
6. **Stop.** Return the report; do not edit the source document unless the caller
   explicitly asks for the edit.

## LLM Judgment

Use judgment only for:

- whether a criterion is semantically observable and outcome-focused;
- whether an edge case is material to this Epic;
- the wording of a replacement criterion.

Do not turn every criterion into Given/When/Then, and do not lint implementation
detail.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and ask if there are no acceptance criteria.
- Stop if the source is not an Epic or story; report the wrong input.
- Do not invent requirements or silently change scope.

## Token Budget

- Default: read the criteria, the Epic/story around them, and the doctrine file.
  Read a referenced contract only when a criterion cannot be judged without it.
- Target ≤ 700 words; list criteria that need attention. If there are more than
  10 findings, group the lowest-severity ones.
- Do not restate good criteria or the full source.
